# 0x00-python_variable_annotations
In this project, I explore the concept of variable annotations in Python. I learn how to specify function signatures and variable types using type annotations. I also gain knowledge about duck typing and how to validate code using the `mypy` tool.

#### 0-add.py
I implement a type-annotated function called `add` that takes two float numbers as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

#### 1-concat.py
In this task, I create a type-annotated function called `concat` that takes two string arguments and returns their concatenated string.

#### 2-floor.py
I implement a type-annotated function called `floor` that takes a float number as an argument and returns its floor value as an integer.

#### 3-to_str.py
In this task, I create a type-annotated function called `to_str` that takes a float number as an argument and returns its string representation.

#### 4-define_variables.py
I define and annotate several variables with the specified values, including an integer, a float, a boolean, and a string.

#### 5-sum_list.py
I implement a type-annotated function called `sum_list` that takes a list of float numbers as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

#### 6-sum_mixed_list.py
In this task, I create a type-annotated function called `sum_mixed_list` that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

#### 7-to_kv.py
I implement a type-annotated function called `to_kv` that takes a string and an integer or float as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string argument concatenated with the square of the numerical argument, while the second element is the numerical argument squared.

#### 8-make_multiplier.py
In this task, I create a type-annotated function called `make_multiplier` that takes a float as an argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by the multiplier.

#### 9-element_length.py
I implement a type-annotated function called `element_length` that takes a list `lst` as an argument and returns a list of integers representing the lengths of the elements in `lst`.

#### 10-sum_mixed_list.py
In this task, I create a type-annotated function called `sum_mixed_list` that takes a list `mxd_lst` of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

#### 11-floor.py
I implement a type-annotated function called `floor` that takes a float `n` as an argument and returns the floor value of the float as an integer.

## Requirements
